### Theory


It's proof by induction.
```
The hypothesis: 
For n % 7 in [0, 1], the first player loses, otherwise the first player wins.

The anchor:
Clearly, for 0 or 1 stones, the first player has no move, so he loses. 
For any of 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 stones, the first player can make a move that leaves 0 or 1 stones for the second player, 
so the first player wins.

Induction step: 
Now, for a given starting position n we assume that our hypothesis is true for all m < n.
If n % 7 in [0, 1], we can only leave the second player with positions (n - 2) % 7 in [5, 6], (n - 3) % 7 in [4, 5], 
or (n - 5) % 7 = [2, 3], all of which mean – by induction – that the second player will be in a winning position. 
Thus, for n % 7 in [0, 1], the first player loses.
If n % 7 in [2, 3, 4, 5, 6], there's always a move to leave the second player with an m % 7 in [0, 1], 
thus – again by induction – forcing a loss on the second player, leaving the first player to win.
That concludes the proof.
The invariant is, that once a player A can force [0, 1] on player B, 
A can keep forcing that position, while B cannot force it on A.
