Dear Ronald,
 
Thank you so much for your kind update and your feedback helped me a lot to improve my technical interview skill for the next chance.
I 100% respect Sunny's decision and hope he will find a strong developer.
I learned something valuable for my career because after the interview I made small program based on his topic and understand what he wants to know.
 
At the same time, I know that different people has different strong points. Because during the interview I also sensed he doesn't have a strong basic in Java collections as well as algorithm or mathematics J
Nowadays knowing the algorithm and data structure is more important than basic theory for many software developers especially in big data field. Because it's all about problem solving skills.
It is one of main reasons when Google and Amazon looking for software engineers, they want to see how much knowledge in algorithm the candidate put into practice.
 
Maybe for your career it is good to know that many software companies are seriously getting to know the coding competition site; hackerrank and leetcode are one of them.

Every month I join "Week Of Code", and currently I only ranked more or less in 10% of candidates. (For example, last month I ranked 613/ 6940 participants and I am pushing myself to be in 3-400 out of 7,000)
Because I realized that nowadays big software companies are looking for developers who can complete this competition in less than 3-4%. (After joining several competition, personally I believe that anyone within in 3-4% in a coding competition won't have any technical problem for any projects.) That's my short term period target and that's my ideal software team I really wish to join.
 
As you know, I also had another technical interview with Rafael Dos Santos after you referred me to Levey, Andrew Andrew.Levey@td.com last Wednesday. To be honest, I am expecting a more positive feedback from him because he asked me many similar questions and I realized he is also very strong in software knowledge.
I really appreciate all the opportunities you gave me and wish to have further challenges.

Thanks and regards,
Simon Park
