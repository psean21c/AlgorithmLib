## Fenwick tree / BIT(Binary Indexed Tree)

A Fenwick tree or binary indexed tree is a data structure that can efficiently update elements and calculate prefix sums in a table of numbers. This structure was proposed by Peter Fenwick in 1994 to improve the efficiency of arithmetic coding compression algorithms.

When compared with a flat array of numbers, the Fenwick tree achieves a much better balance between two operations: element update and prefix sum calculation. 
The tree structure allows operations to be performed using only O(log n) node accesses.
