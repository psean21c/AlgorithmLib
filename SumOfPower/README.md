Input Format

The first line contains an integer X. 

The second line contains an integer N.

Constraints

1 <= X <= 1000

2 <=N <=10

Output Format

Output a single integer, the answer to the problem explained above.

Sample 1

If  X=10 and N=2, we need to find the number of ways that 10 can be represented as the sum of squares of unique numbers. 

This is the only way in which  can be expressed as the sum of unique squares.
